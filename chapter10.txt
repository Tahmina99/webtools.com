chapter 10(Accessing MySQL with PHP)


1.The Process
	The process of using MySQL with PHP is:
	1. Connect to MySQL.
	2. Select the database to use.
	3. Build a query string.
	4. Perform the query.
	5. Retrieve the results and output them to a web page.
	6. Repeat Steps 3 to 5 until all desired data has been retrieved.
	7. Disconnect from MySQL.
2.creating a login file:
	First we create a login file which include hostname,database name,user name,password.
3.connecting to mysql:
	After creating a login file we connect this file to mysql.Here we use require_once statement.
	The login.php file is connected to the database by use mysql_connect() function by the following way:
	<?php
	require_once 'login.php';
	$db_server = mysql_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password);
	if (!$db_server) die("Unable to connect to MySQL: " . mysql_error());
	?>
4.Selecting a database:
	we select a database by use the mysql_select_db() function by the way:
	<?php
        mysql_select_db($db_database)
	or die("Unable to select database: " . mysql_error());
	?>
5.Building and executing a query:
	we can build and execute a query by the way:
	<?php
	$query = "SELECT * FROM customer";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
	if (!$result) die ("Database access failed: " . mysql_error());
	?>
6.Fetching a result
7.fetching a row:A row is fetched by the use of myqsl_fetch_row() function
8.closing a coonection:the connection is closed by use mysql_close($db_server)
9.The $_POST Array:
	$_POST is an associative array. Depending on
	whether a form has been set to use the POST or the GET method, either the $_POST or the
	$_GET associative array will be populated with the form data. They can both be read in
	exactly the same way.
10.Deleting a Record:
11.Displaying the Form:here we use echo<<<_END structure,where outputs are display between the _END tags
12.Querying the Database:
13.Practical MySQL:
14.creating a table:
CREATE TABLE cats (
id SMALLINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
family VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
age TINYINT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id));
15.Describing a Table
	$query = "DESCRIBE customers";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
16.Dropping a Table
	$query = "DROP customers";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
17.Adding Data
	$query = "INSERT INTO customers VALUES('tani','main','Dhaka')";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
18.Updating Data:
	$query = "UPDATE customers SET name='Charlie' WHERE name='Charly'";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
19.Deleting Data:
	$query = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE name='tani'";
	$result = mysql_query($query);
